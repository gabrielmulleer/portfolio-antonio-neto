              <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
              <p>
                In the dynamic world of beauty salons, effective communication
                with clients is crucial. Salons face a significant challenge:
                the manual and time-consuming process of sending appointment
                reminders via WhatsApp. This traditional method is prone to
                errors and forgetfulness, leading to no-shows which negatively
                impact the salon's revenue and operational efficiency.
              </p>
              <h3>The Need for an Innovative Solution</h3>
              <p>
                The need was clear: a solution that would automate
                communication, ensuring clients received timely and personalized
                reminders, and at the same time, be user-friendly for salon
                professionals. This challenge presented a unique opportunity to
                explore how UX can transform a routine task into a more
                efficient and enjoyable experience for both salons and their
                clients.
